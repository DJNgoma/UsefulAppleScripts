# Useful AppleScripts by DJNgoma

Currently maintaining a set of scripts I use for music management. Probably write a few more to handle a few other things on my Mac.

## List of included scripts (Just copy and paste into the Script Editor)

The current set of scripts are being used in conjunction with [Breakaway](https://github.com/steakknife/breakaway):

- spotifyPause
For pausing spotify.

- spotifyPlay
For playing spotify.

- volumeFadeIn
For fading in the volume (making it louder)

- volumeFadeOut
For fading out the volume (making it quieter)

- volumeKill
Simply mutes the volume
